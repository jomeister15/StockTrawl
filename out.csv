"Hoping GoPro earnings are shitfucked AH. No clue why it ran up today but that shits got me nervous on my 8/3 put.

Has anyone bought a GoPro since 2014? Fuck"
Looking at where TSLA opens. If they open around 330 I'm picking up a bunch because a short squeeze could be coming in hot.
Find whoever suggested shorting P and beat them with a shovel
Can you imagine how much everything would rally today as a result of AAPL's earnings if it weren't for the tariff announcement? Why does he have to crash the party?
"if i didn't have so many LEAPs in the red, i'd be converting to shares right now. i am so bad at this even when i'm right.

for example: i realized there was a common theme with every alcohol distributor/brewery getting hit hard after ER this quarter ($STZ, $BUD, $SAM, etc.) so I decided to buy puts on $TAP. I was right! Mixed results led to a drop pre-market. 

But then they announced they are starting a partnership with a canadian weed company to make cannabis drinks and they went from negative to +5% over the course of the morning. I got out when they went flat for a small loss, but still. so frustrating."

"Also if you aren't buying baidu calls for short medium term, wtf are you doing? Dropped 30 bucks over night despite beating EPS by almost a dollar. 8/17 call for 235 will be well within the money by then. Only reason is fucking trade war fears but they practically serve china only as it is."

"I honestly don't understand why it's down this much.  Listened to the call and expanded sales force for higher frequency/strategic targeting of PCPs/big payor wins are exactly what they needed.

Q4 3 years ago was their first real quarter of sales and the test is indicated for once every 3 years so they'll be ready for their first ""repeat"" customers Q4 of this year.

New colonoscopy guidelines now recommend screening age 5 years earlier than before which means bigger patient population.  They don't have the indication for this yet but said they are preparing to discuss with the FDA and I don't see any reason why the FDA wouldn't approve considering you're much more likely to get a 40 something to use this than go in for a colonoscopy.  Plus it will likely get used off label for the time being.

Left and his faggy bois over at citron are shorting this because of improvements in blood testing for CRC to replace screening colonoscopies but that won't happen until at least 2022 and there's still TONS of market share and they have other cancer tests in the pipe.

It was on a run so I guess any bad news sent it back to earth but may be a good entry point once the dust settles.
