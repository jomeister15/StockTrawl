genuine question: why the fuck do you fucks continue to buy MU calls after seeing it repeatedly get butt fucked? Don't tell me "you have to understand" cause I FUCKING DON'T
call
Oil update: so in making my call yesterday I overlooked the fact that their were some substantially important meetings coming up this week. Im referring to the short-term outlook report by EIA today (12pm), OPEC meeting tomorrow, and IEA report on Thursday  (on top of the standard weekly API report and Weekly EIA report).

This week has the potential to go either direction depending on how things play out

The good: Genscape who I trust more than any other analyst group (even more than API) is  expecting a crude draw this week. Tropical storm gordon although not as strong as expected did have an impact on supply as wellwhere analyst estimate about a decrease of 100k barrels a day 

Additionally, as I mentioned yesterday, the spread between WTI crude and Brent is the highest it's been in awhile ($10 spread). Why is this important? Because it makes WTI crude much more appealing price wise as opposed to Brent, the effect being that Korea and Japan have significantly increased their imports from the US since the start of September. 200k of barrels a day to Korea and 100k to Japan is what's being estimated. India has also went on to say that it would not being ordering from Iran come October and will likely replace that oil (some) with WTI crude. 

Also, Canada is continuing NAFTA talks today and any kind of progress/deal being made would be good for crude prices. US met with EU as well over trade and could also benefit crude.

The bad: There are talks going around that OPEC might agree to up their production by an additional 1 million barrels a day to offset the lack of supply coming from Iran, Venezuela, and Libya. Now this could have an affect on WTI crude prices because it would bring down the price of brent and make the price more appealing again to other countries. With that being said, some people are saying that OPEC may not have the spare production capacity to meet the demand in this tightened oil market. We will have a clearer picture when Saudi Arabia releases it's production numbers for August. So that's a toss up.

Additionally, sept 15 in considered the end of the driving season and we typically see a drop in gasoline prices as refineries switch other to cheaper winter blends. A big reason for the drop last week was due to a build in gas and distillates regardless of the crude draw. Analyst are mixed on gas builds/draws this week, we will have a better picture when API releases their report. 

On top of all that, the on going China trade war is bad for crude, so trump tweeting anything implying an escalation could affect prices as well.

For now I'm holding on to my Calls, but I'll be watching things very closely this week.

Thanks to our resident oil baron, I'm up 76% today. Not sure if I should hold these USO 9/14 calls through tomorrow's EIA report or if I should sell EoD today. I may take profit and run but you know, FOMO. 

Edit: sold my 9/14 calls and locked in some nice profit. Holding my 9/21 calls.
